# Qortium Home Change Log

This is the main human-readable record of the Qortium Home application effort.
It is written for non-developers first, with the goal of making each change
easy to follow without reading code.

## What Qortium Home Is

Qortium Home is a simple user interface for managing Qortium/Qortal-compatible
wallets, connecting to a configured node, browsing QDN content, and viewing
chain/API data.

The aim is to keep the application focused and understandable. Qortal Hub can
be used as a reference for compatible wallet behavior, QDN concepts, and native
app patterns, but Qortium Home should remain a smaller application with its own
clear scope.

## Early Goals

- keep the history clean and easy to read
- make each logical change its own commit
- explain every meaningful change in plain language
- keep early implementation choices documented before code grows around them
- preserve compatibility decisions separately from future implementation details

## How To Use This File

- update this file with every intentional Qortium Home commit
- use one entry per commit
- make each entry title match the commit message exactly
- keep each entry to one combined plain-language description
- keep entries understandable to non-developers
- use this file as the public narrative of the application, alongside the
  technical git history

## Change Entries

### 2026-05-25 - app: add node status indicator

Added a small node status indicator to the main Qortium Home screen. It checks the default Qortium Previewnet node at `localhost:62391`, reports whether the node is unavailable, syncing, minting, or synced, and shows chain peers, data peers, block height, and sync percent in a compact details panel.

### 2026-05-25 - app: scaffold minimal Electron AppImage

Added the first runnable Qortium Home application scaffold with Vite, React, TypeScript, Electron, and electron-builder. The app currently opens to a minimal page that says `Qortium Home`, includes the build scripts needed for local development and Linux x64 AppImage packaging, and keeps generated dependencies and release artifacts out of git.

### 2026-05-25 - docs: record initial project plan

Added the initial Qortium Home planning document and changelog. The plan records the chosen React, Vite, TypeScript, Electron, electron-builder, and Capacitor Android stack; the first Linux x64 AppImage target; the initial one-page scope before tabs; Qortal Hub-compatible wallet import/export with future derived-address support; Qortium Previewnet and custom node connection options; and the features intentionally deferred until after the first testable scaffold.
